		Two ways you can move a div around the page:
				Absolute positioning, and css floats. I will need to read into this.
		
		How to stick a div at the bottom or top of a page:
				Relative positioning will achieve this with padding.
				
		How to identify the background color of a page:
				While using the developer tool for Firefox and chrome, I can easily CTRLF for background and 
				find the tag and color associated with that tag. It's simpler with html, but css uses it as well.
		
		How to grab the URL for an image from an existing website:
				This is easily done in Chrome, where it's right click context menu allows this option. However,
				if one needs to do this from the dev tools, It would be just an issue of identifying the element
				in the code and copying the URL from the source.
				
		How to center an element horizontally:
				This was achieved by using tables, and those tables could be attributed to align to the center. 
				I don't remember how to do this in CSS right now, but it's something I will be reading up on along
				with the div positioning.
				
		Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page:
				<style>, <link>, and inline style attributes
		
		Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page:
				ID's are specific to individual elements, and classes are groups of elements that may be scattered through the
				page.
