Hello!
Today's been interesting. I set up a VM, installed Ubuntu Linux on it, and then fought with the ruby and rails installers.
		Spoiler: I won. Babysteps acheived! :D

So far, I've also learned about Git, Heroku, and Github, and am implimenting some of the things I have learned by creating this document, making it a part of my repository, and then documenting the changes that these files and documents encounter.
